    The Assistant Commissioner Latifabad / Focal Person for District has reported with great concern that apart from arresting illegal Foreigners, which is a small and handful in numbers, the District Police in Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas Divisions is arresting the bona fide citizens of Pakistan carrying valid CNICs, moreover, the NADRA officials deployed at the Holding Point (RTC) Hyderabad do not have authorization / permission to verify the CNICs of the detainees on the spot. This act on the part of NADRA and Police growing agitation amongst inmates of the Holding Point Hyderabad. Thus, he requested that the process of verification of CNIC holders by the NADRA designated officials should immediately be commenced and expedited so that verified detainees may be released at once and the cases of undocumented and unidentified illegal foreigners may be forwarded for repatriation / deportation.
      
    As per the directions / SoPs of Government, at the first stage, the Police must get verified the arrested illegal foreigners from the NADRA at their District, but the facts reported by the Assistant Commissioner Latifabad / Focal Person for District Hyderabad has surfaced that the suspected illegal foreigners arrested by the District Police from Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas Divisions are directly sent to Holding Point Hyderabad without proper verification of their identity i.e. PoR or ACC and CNICs which increases the burden over management of holding point (RTC). The NADRA Authorities are reluctant to provide details in this respect and giving lame excuses with different baseless reasons. The designated staff of NADRA at holding point have clearly rejected to verify the CNIC holders reported by the District Police.

    Current challenges in repatriation process within Hyderabad involve a lack o coordination with NADRA, leadig to delay in the verification of NICs data.

    In view of the above narrated facts, it is suggested that the Home Department GoS Karachi may be moved to issue proper guidelines / directions to the Police Authorities that, before sending the arrested illegal foreigners to the Holding Point, proper verification regarding their identity i.e. ACC, PoR, CNICs must be carried out from NADRA and then only undocumented / illegal foreigner should be sent to the Holding Point at Hyderabad for further repatriatio to their destination i.e Chaman Border.

    Furthermore, NADRA should also be directed to make a proper mechanism in coordination with LEAs to verify the suspected foreigners who bear ACC, PoR or CNICs / MNICs and the facitily in this regard must be available in all the districts to verify the suspected foreigners timely in order to avoid complication in this national cause.
